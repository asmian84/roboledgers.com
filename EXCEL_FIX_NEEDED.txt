CRITICAL FIX NEEDED for excel-exporter.js

Line 218 currently says:
    } else if (txn.credits && Math.abs(txn.credits) > 0) {

CHANGE IT TO (remove the "else"):
    }
    
    if (txn.credits && Math.abs(txn.credits) > 0) {

This allows BOTH debit and credit to be checked on the same transaction.

The problem: if/else means only ONE gets checked. Your transactions have BOTH fields populated, so removing "else" allows both to show in the export.
