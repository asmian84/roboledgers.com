# AutoBookkeeping v1.2 - The "Self-Driving" Release 🏎️🤖

## 🚀 Major Upgrade: Auto-Smart Vendor System
We have transformed the Vendor Dictionary from a static list into a **living, self-cleaning organism**.

### 1. Turbo-Charged Optimization Loop ⚡
*   **50x Speed Boost**: The background optimizer now runs at **50 items per second** (CPU-bound) instead of waiting for network requests.
*   **Decoupled Sync**: Optimization happens instantly on your device, with Cloud Sync happening quietly in the background.
*   **Result**: 300+ duplicates can be cleaned and consolidated in under 10 seconds.

### 2. "Ghost Buster" Logic 👻🚫
*   **Strict Filtering**: Checks likely "blank" rows (including invisible characters) and hides them immediately.
*   **Auto-Pruning**: If the AI cleans a name down to nothing, it is effectively deleted.
*   **Regex Power**: Added explicit rules for stubborn patterns:
    *   `Send Etfr` / `Tfrto` → **Transfer**
    *   `Wal Mart` / `Costco Whse` → **Walmart** / **Costco**
    *   `Amzn Mktp` / `Amz` → **Amazon**

### 3. Real-Time "Stock Ticker" UI 📉
*   **Live Updates**: You no longer need to reload to see changes.
*   **Visual Merges**: Watch duplicates vanish and main entries update their stats in real-time.
*   **Instant Feedback**: "Standard" optimizations (e.g., fixing a typo) now update the grid immediately.

## 🎨 UI Enhancements
### Vendor Dictionary
*   **Status Column**: New indicator showing "☁️ Cloud" vs "💾 Offline" status.
*   **Rainbow Theme**: Applied the beautiful row coloring to the Vendor Grid for consistency.
*   **Smart Display**: The grid now shows the *Cleaned* name (Title Case) instead of raw database garbage.

### Controls
*   **Simplified Toolbar**: Removed redundant "Import" and "Sync" buttons (everything is automatic now).
*   **Restored Bulk Index**: Kept the one button that matters for power users.
